    Returns a [paginated](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#pagination) list of [notification schemes](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg) in order by display name.

    ### About notification schemes

    A notification scheme is a list of events and recipients who will receive notifications for those events. The list is contained within the `notificationSchemeEvents` object and contains pairs of `events` and `notifications`:

    *   `event` Identifies the type of event. The events can be [Jira system events](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg#Creatinganotificationscheme-eventsEvents) or [custom events](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/AIlKLg).
    *   `notifications` Identifies the [recipients](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg#Creatinganotificationscheme-recipientsRecipients) of notifications for each event. Recipients can be any of the following types:

    *   `CurrentAssignee`
    *   `Reporter`
    *   `CurrentUser`
    *   `ProjectLead`
    *   `ComponentLead`
    *   `User` (the `parameter` is the user key)
    *   `Group` (the `parameter` is the group name)
    *   `ProjectRole` (the `parameter` is the project role ID)
    *   `EmailAddress`
    *   `AllWatchers`
    *   `UserCustomField` (the `parameter` is the ID of the custom field)
    *   `GroupCustomField`(the `parameter` is the ID of the custom field)

    _Note that you should allow for events without recipients to appear in responses._

    **[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/FQiiLQ) required:** None, however the requesting user must have permission to administer at least one project associated with a notification scheme for it to be returned.
